		The most interesting thing that i have learnt is designing. It has no limits or no boundaries. The very thing
		that inspired me to go into the field of designing is the limitless possibilities it can have and also that it
		can never be dull or tiring. Thus taking up the major field in designing I learnt some skills as UI designing, Video Editing, Photo editing,
		etc. 
		<br><br>
		Talking about my hobbies I like to play videogames the most favourite of mine right now is Valorant a 5v5 first
		person shooter game that involves tactics and team strategies to play.
		<br><br>
		I like listening to Sherlock Holmes stories the speckled band was one of the most interesting Sherlock Holmes
		story I have ever heard followed by the red headed league and the hound of Baskervilles. I also like listening
		to lyrical, instrumental and classical music, learning about historical stories like the one of Tutankhamun
		who’s mummified coffin was recently discovered.
		<br><br>
		I love playing sports like volleyball, football, cricket, and badminton.
		And if I was given enough time to watch a long series I’ll be definitely going with Mahabharata, Ramayana or
		Devon Ke Dev Mahadev.
		<br><br>
		Speaking of my designing interests I like to make text reveal animations in after effects, editing with
		Snapseed, photoshop, pics art, canva, and like to design ideas of mobile UI in the free time.
		Designing comes from inspiration and who is better inspirer than the nature itself. I love nature, and the
		season I love the most is The Monsoon where the whole earth glows with the new life. “The first shining droplets
		that drop down the rain touches the still water of pond making a perfect ripple” just imagining this makes my
		imagination skyrocket.
		<br><br>
		The nature will remain intact for ages. And the rain will rejuvenate the earth. Inspiring me every time, the
		beauty of designing.
